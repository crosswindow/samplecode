sensor_source sample code:   
Project device is (https://www.flocksafety.com/products/flock-cameras) a camera device to capture the vehicle details to solve crime. It requires power saving, robust in long time and critical timing for snapshot. sensor_source_sample is part of solution(other parts are on camera stack and application) which I implemented based on Qualcomm camera stack.


watchdog_source sample code:  
After the devices are installed on the field, there is an issue that the sever could not connect to sone of the devices. I proposed and implmented watchdog_source_sample as "heartbeat" solution for the customer. This solution will recover the device when system is in wrong state.
